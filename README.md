# Integer Factroials Using Loops
A program that will determine factorial values of integers starting with the number 1 and displaying all factorials up to a user inputted value.

## Constraints
- Factorials and their results should be displayed as: 4! = 24

## Requirements
- Display an opening welcome statement and menu with the following options:
      1. Run Program
      2. Exit Program
- Use a switch/case block.
- Use a for loop to determine and output the data.
- Implement a do..while loop to run the program again.

## Notes
- Factorials grow exponentially.. consider BigInteger.
